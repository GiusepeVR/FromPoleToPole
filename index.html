                The medieval ruins of Cricieth Castle overlook the town from a
                rock overlooking the sea. It is believed to have been built by
                Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. 800 years later, the
                self-styled Pearl of Wales on the shores of Snowdonia has become
                a popular tourist destination during the summer months.

                Just a short walk from the castle, you can enjoy the best ice
                cream in the world at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is
                rumored to be local seaweed. Another thing Cricieth is famous
                for is winning the Wales in Bloom award for five years in a row
                for its spectacular floral displays around the town. It was also
                the birthplace of David Lloyd George, the only Welshman to have
                been Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

                Berea is a small city located in the central part of Kentucky.
                The city is surrounded by beautiful woods and fields. It is
                known as the craft capital of the state, and visitors will find
                endless shopping opportunities: jewelry, candle and wood craft
                stores, galleries, glass workshops and more. The city holds an
                annual festival that pays tribute to “spoonbread,” a local dish
                made from cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.

                Although, it is probably best known for its college. Berea
                College was founded in 1855 and was the first racially
                integrated southern college, as well as the first to be
                coeducational. Something that makes it somewhat unique is that
                it does not charge tuition: each student receives a 100%
                scholarship.

                Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. During the time
                of the kingdom, Muramvya was its capital; and in 2017, thanks to
                its cultural and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO
                Tentative World Heritage List. It is located in the center of
                Burundi, between the political and economic capitals of the
                country.

                Its climate is rather cold at night, but during the day, you
                might think you are in paradise. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft)
                above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the
                province. But it's just that cool breeze that gives rise to one
                of the country's largest tea and coffee plantations, which
                account for the majority of Burundi's exports.

                The west of Mexico City is an area that combines history,
                modernity and nature in a unique environment. Comprised of

                It is also home to some of the city's most emblematic monuments,

                Chapultepec Forest, the largest green lung of the metropolis. In
                its shadow, world-renowned museums, such as the National Museum
                of Anthropology and the Tamayo Museum, invite visitors to
                immerse themselves in art and history.
